Currently, there is no course nor experimental research on energy storage and batteries at The Cooper Union due to lacking infrastructure. My role was to pioneer more 'homemade' methods of introducing battery research to undergraduate students to prompt the administration to raise funds for a battery lab. Rudimentary lithium ion batteries were created and tested in the makeshift lab using air-safe materials and domestically available equipment.",
